      README.TXT         - this file is about the software and its installation
   

      CHEMFLO.jar        - contains the compiled Java program
      CHEMFLO.bat        - contains a batch file usable in Windows
 

2. Platforms:

CHEMFLO-2000 is written in Java 2. Therefore it can be used on any computer system 
supporting Java 2. This includes Windows 95 / 98 / ME /NT / 2000 / XP, Linux, 
and Solaris. The software requires at least 64 MB random access memory (RAM) with 128 MB 
or more recommended. A fixed disk with 30 MB space is required to install the 
Java Runtime Environment. The compiled software and soil data file require 
less than 1 MB additional disk space. The software is written for a computer 
with a color monitor supporting at least 800x600 pixel resolution. 


3. Software Installation: 

Currently, the EPA version of CHEMFLO-2000 is in the form of a stand-alone Java 
application. There are three components of the CHEMFLO package. 
They are the Java software, the CHEMFLO-2000 program, and the user's manual. 
These are all available for downloading free of charge. 
Installation instructions are given below.

Java Software Installation:
The CHEMFLO application requires the Java 1.3.1 (or later) runtime environment. 
If that software is already loaded on the computer to be used, skip the remainder of 
this section and proceed with the next step: CHEMFLO-2000 Software Installation. 
If it is not loaded, download a copy of the runtime environment 
from http://java.sun.com/j2se . This is a compressed executable file. 
After downloading it and saving it in a temporary directory, 
install it on the computer by running the program. This leads the user 
through the installation process. Accepting the default values presented 
by the installation software is suggested.

Note: 
   If you are using the Linux or Solaris operating systems, follow the installation
   instructions available from the Sun Microsystems site listed above. 
   
   This installation process is required only once, no matter how many different 
   Java applications are used on your computer.
   

CHEMFLO-2000 Software Installation:
The Standalone Application available for downloading from this site underwent 
Agency peer review. The application is stored in a zip file that is 
approximately 0.5 MB in size. Save the file in a temporary directory. 
Extract the files into the Chemflo2000 directory (or another directory of choice). 
This folder should now contain CHEMFLO.jar, CHEMFLO.bat, and README.TXT.
   
   
4. Running the stand-alone version of CHEMFLO-2000: The standalone application
   program can be executed in several ways.  
       i.   The program can be executed by double clicking on the Chemflo.bat 
            file name from Windows Explorer.
       ii.  The program can be executed by using the Run Chemflo.bat command
       iii. The program can be executed from a command (or terminal) window by
            making the Chemflo2000 folder the current folder and issuing the 
            command  
                   java -jar CHEMFLO.jar
       iv.  A shortcut to the Chemflo.bat file can be created and placed on 
            the Windows desktop. The program can then be run by double clicking on 
            this icon.
