I. HOW TO USE ROSETTA
-------------------------------------------

STEP 1) Select the predictive model that best matches the available soil data:

     Model 1 (TXT):
          Soil textural classes (USDA classification: sand, silty loam, clay loam, etc)
     Model 2 (SSC):
          Texture percentages (%sand, %silt, %clay)
     Model 3 (SSCBD):
          Textural percentages and bulk density (BD)
     Model 4 (SSCBDTH33):
          As model 3, but with water content at 33 kPa suction (TH33)
     Model 5 (SSCBDTH331500):
          As model 4, but with water content at 1500 kPa suction (TH1500)

STEP 2) Type the input data in the white input fields.  Rosetta will give an error message if the
data are inappropriate or out of range. The constraints on the different input variables are:

     Percentages sand, silt and clay should sum up to 100 % (permissible range: 99-101%)
     Bulk density should range between 0.5 and 2.0 gr/cm3
     The 33 and 1500 kPa water contents should range between 0.0 and 1.0 cm3/cm3

STEP 3) Click the <Predict> button to make a prediction of the water retention parameters and
saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soil textural class appears in the class field if you are
running models 2 to 4.

STEP 4) Clicking  <Accept> will return the predicted values to HYDRUS, the <Cancel> button
allows you to return without any predicted values. Alternatively, select another model (Step 1)
and make a new prediction.


II. BACKGROUND
---------------------------

Soil hydraulic characteristics (water retention and hydraulic conductivity) are required for many
studies of water and solute transport in the vadose zone. Although measurements are the most
obvious and precise way to obtain these characteristics, financial and time constraints place limits
how much can be determined in the field or laboratory. Spatial variability of soil hydraulic
characteristics further makes it doubtful whether limited soil hydraulic measurements are
representative for the studied area. Alternatively, soil hydraulic characteristics can be estimated
using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that use widely available basic soil data (texture, bulk density,
etc) as predictors. Although predictions by PTFs are not as accurate as measurements, they
provide a way to obtain soil hydraulic characteristics that would otherwise not have been
available.

Rosetta implements PTFs to predict van Genuchten (1980) water retention parameters  and
saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) by using textural class, textural distribution, bulk density
and one or two water retention points as input. Although the use of more input data often leads to
better predictions (Schaap and Bouten, 1996; Schaap et al., 1998), there are many cases where
only limited soil information is available. Rosetta follows a hierarchical approach to estimate
water retention and Ks values using limited or more extended sets of input data (Schaap et al.,
1998, Schaap and Leij, 1998a). 

The hierarchical approach is reflected in the five models. The simplest model (TXT) consists of a
lookup table for average hydraulic parameters for each soil textural class  (sand, silty loam, clay
loam, etc.). The other four models are based on neural network analysis (Schaap et al., 1998) and
predict the hydraulic parameters, using additional input variables, with an increasing degree of
accuracy. All five models have been calibrated on the same data set and provide consistent
predictions. The calibration data set contained 2134 samples for water retention and 1306 samples
for Ks (Schaap and Leij, 1998b). The samples were obtained from a large number of sources and
involve agricultural and non-agricultural soils in temperate climate zones of the northern
hemisphere (mainly from the USA and some from Europe). Usage of Rosetta for other climate
zones, and hence other pedogenic processes, could lead to inaccurate predictions. The reader is
referred to Schaap et al. (1998) and Schaap and Leij (1998a,b) for more information about the
calibration of the PTFs in Rosetta.


III. DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the data for the calibration of the pedotransfer functions were carefully selected, we do
not assume any responsibility for the correctness and usability of the predicted hydraulic
properties.

It is very important to note that Rosetta and its predictions are subject to change! Rosetta is a
result of a continuing research project and future versions will probably include additional PTFs
that predict different hydraulic functions or use other sets of input data. Due to the calibration on
additional data, the current PTFs may become more applicable to a wider range of soils but may
yield slightly different estimates of the hydraulic parameters. Please check at the USSL web site
(http://www.ussl.ars.usda.gov) for the latest information about Rosetta. At this site a more
extended version of Rosetta can be found to predict hydraulic parameters  from large amounts of 
input data. This version will also provide uncertainty estimates of the predicted hydraulic
parameters which can be used to assess the reliability of the predictions.
