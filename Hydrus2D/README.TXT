
   Welcome to HYDRUS-2D !
   
   HYDRUS-2D is a software package for simulating the two-dimensional
   movement of water, heat, and mutliple solutes in variably-saturated
   media.  Further background on the program may be obtained through 
   manual or the Help menu by selecting Index and then Introduction
   to HYDRUS-2D.

   We included many examples at the installation diskettes which
   should demonstrate the use of the HYDRUS-2D system.  Ten
   examples (TEST1 through TEST7, CONE, DISC, EXTRAC) correspond 
   with the examples described in the HYDRUS-2D manual of versions 2.0
   (Simunek et al. 1999).  Other examples demonstrate other options of
   the program (Workspace DIRECT1).

   If you encounter any problems or errors during program execution,
   have any questions, or have specific suggestions on how to improve 
   the whole system, we would very much appreciate your comments.
